This repository contains all the files required to simulate the Prometheus robot in the Small-Sized League using Robot Operating System (ROS).

## Description

Prometheus is a small-sized robot designed for competitive robot soccer in the Small-Sized League. This repository provides a simulated environment for testing and developing the robot's software.

The simulation environment is built using ROS, Gazebo, and other relevant ROS packages. It includes the necessary configuration files, launch files, and robot models to simulate Prometheus and its interactions with the soccer field and other game entities.

## Requirements

To use this simulation environment, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- ROS (Kinetic, Melodic, or Noetic) - [Installation Guide](https://www.ros.org/install/)
- Gazebo - [Installation Guide](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_wrapper_versions)
- Other ROS packages specific to the Small-Sized League (e.g., [ssl_gazebo](https://github.com/roboime/ssl_gazebo))
